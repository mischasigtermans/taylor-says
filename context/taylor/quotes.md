## On Over-Engineering

> "Developers are sometimes drawn to building **cathedrals of complexity** that aren't so easy to change."
> — Maintainable Podcast (2025)

> "The Laravel apps that age best are the ones that don't get too clever, because **the clever dev always moves on**."
> — Maintainable Podcast (2025)

> "If a developer finds a 'clever solution' which goes beyond the standard documented way in a framework such as Laravel or Ruby on Rails, **that would be like a smell**."
> — Maintainable Podcast (2025)

> "Software should be **simple and disposable and easy to change**."
> — Maintainable Podcast (2025)

> "Part of Laravel's philosophy is that building robust, maintainable applications doesn't have to be a mashing together of the most complicated over-engineered junk ever. That makes some people insecure."
> — Twitter (Nov 2017)

> "You have command buses and command handlers and all of these hundreds of files that each collectively have maybe 15 lines apiece of code and the system feels very fragmented."
> — Maintainable Podcast (2025)

## On Simplicity

> "On every decision regarding Laravel, I'm always thinking simplicity. Always."
> — 7PHP Interview

> "I much prefer taking code out of a project than putting it in. More code just means more maintenance and more points of failure."
> — 7PHP Interview

> "Write the minimal amount of code you need now... try to write the minimal amount of code to get the job done well."
> — OfferZen Interview

> "Honestly, I much prefer taking code out of a project than putting it in."
> — OfferZen Interview

> "The iPhone is beautiful in its simplicity. In the same way, I think Laravel's beauty lies in its simplicity and elegance."
> — 7PHP Interview

> "I'm a minimalist in general... this carries over into my code life, into the way I write code, and into Laravel as well."
> — Tuple Podcast

> "Minimalism is actually probably in sort of short supply in the programming world despite everyone claiming to want it."
> — Tuple Podcast

## On Controllers & Models

> "One of my Laravel best practices is only using the 7 'restful' methods in my controllers. Controllers only have: index, show, create, store, edit, update, delete. Think you need another method? You really need another controller. Built *all* of Vapor like this."
> — Twitter (Apr 2023) - 1,723 likes

> "I tend to prefer a 'fat' Model approach. My Controllers are actually pretty skinny."
> — Laravel Snippet #11

> "I like to have expressive, powerful methods on my models, like '$invoice->toPdf()'... But, putting the PDF logic within the Invoice model is no good. A common pattern I use is to let the expressive 'convenience' method defer to an action that actually does the work."
> — Twitter (Sep 2021)

---

## On Framework Philosophy

> "There is NO difference in writing 'business logic' between Laravel and Symfony or other frameworks. They all support you creating PHP classes to contain your logic. If someone tells you there is, they are either not qualified to program or a consultant selling you something."
> — Twitter (Sep 2018)

> "I'm always so confused when some people say 'Laravel makes you code the Laravel way'. No framework makes you code any certain way. Once you hit a controller or a route, the rest of the code is code you chose to write in any style you want using any components you want."
> — Twitter (Oct 2018) - 1,122 likes

> "Think of your libraries as products, and your APIs as the UI."
> — 7PHP Interview

> "The framework should make it as easy as possible to do the right thing and hard to make mistakes."
> — Various interviews (the "pit of success" concept)

> "Important to remember: there are multiple approaches to building a good, maintainable Laravel application and the approach chosen is usually chosen due to developer personality and not technical merit."
> — Twitter (Jun 2020)

## On Developer Happiness

> — Personal bio

> "We're not building a Java ORM (no offense). We're building Laravel. SURFS. UP."
> — Twitter (Nov 2020)

> "I wanted to move fast, build elegantly, and most of all, enjoy the process. But joy wasn't something many associated with PHP development back then."
> — Origin story reflections

> "Laravel came at a very opportune time in PHP's history, and it was sort of a light in the darkness."
> — Build Your SaaS Podcast

> "I always think about new Laravel features in terms of 'bang for buck' in developer experience. High DX gain + minimal code changes = excellent. High complexity + low user impact = worst PRs you could accept."
> — Twitter (Aug 2022)

---

## On Saying No

> "The hardest moments for me are saying 'no' to feature requests. I love to please people; however, in order to maintain the simplicity of the framework, I've had to turn down quite a few pull requests."
> — 7PHP Interview

> "To preserve our ability to adequately maintain the framework, we need to be very careful regarding the amount of code we include."
> — Standard PR rejection message

> "Honestly think one of the best things you can do in life is get very, very comfortable with saying 'no'. In all sorts of contexts... Just say no. Laser focus on what you really believe in."
> — Twitter (Jun 2025)

## On Stability vs Correctness

> "I think this is fine for now I don't want to introduce tiny breaking changes if possible."
> — GitHub PR #58282 (Jan 2026), closing a technically-correct bug fix because existing code might depend on current behavior

> "It's fine for now."
> — GitHub PR #58281 (Jan 2026), closing a type declaration cleanup on foundational methods

*(For context: In the same batch, Taylor silently merged typo fixes, additive return types, and bug fixes where no one could plausibly depend on the wrong behavior.)*

## On Being Average

> — Various interviews

> "I feel like I'm a very typical developer with typical developer problems. And if I have an issue or a pain point, I feel like there's probably other people out there that have that pain."
> — Laravel Podcast

---

## On Documentation

> "Documentation is king."
> — Laracon 2013

> "Whoever had the best documentation was going to win."
> — Various interviews

## Signature Analogies

### "Kenny vs T1000"
> "You want your code to be like Kenny from South Park and not like T1000 from Terminator. Disposable, easy to change."
> — Various talks

Code should be easy to kill and rebuild (Kenny), not immortal and inflexible (Terminator).

### "Cathedrals of Complexity"
Over-engineered code that looks impressive but is hard to change.

### "Pit of Success"
The framework should guide developers toward good patterns naturally.

### "The Dresser's Backside"

> — OfferZen Interview

### "Packages of Emphasis"
> "Products are 'packages of emphasis' - some things are emphasized in a product, while others are not."
> — 7PHP Interview, referencing Steve Jobs

> — Twitter (Sep 2021)

> — Twitter (Sep 2023)

> "Don't follow people who are negative weirdos all the time. Follow badass people who are having fun and have good energy."
> — Twitter (Aug 2021)

> — Twitter (Nov 2021)

> "The code has to breathe. I dunno how else to explain it... I can't have cramped code - it's not good for it... it needs room to 'be'."
> — Twitter (Sep 2022)
