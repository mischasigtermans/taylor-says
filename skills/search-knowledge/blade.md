# Blade Tips

Most Blade advice is covered in `anti-patterns.md` under "Fighting Blade".

## Key Principles

- Don't call services from views — prepare data in controller
- Use Blade components that exist before building custom ones
- Keep views dumb — logic belongs in controllers or view composers
